# Machine-learning-classification-of-new-asteroid-families-members
Repository for the codes necessary to identify new members of asteroid families. Algorthms for the ExtraTree. KNN, XGBoost and Adaboost methods are provided with this repository.  The first steps to set up the models are described below.  The codes are available in the branches ZONE_SELECTION and CLASSIFICATION.  

1) As a first step, create the proper element files for the asteroid region of interest with the codes in the ZONE_SELECTION branch.  Read the Readme file there for further instructions.

2) Copy the proper element file and the asteroid family in AFP format to the CLASSIFICATION branch.  Follow the instructions in the local Readme file to create the updated list of new family members.
